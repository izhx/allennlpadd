# allennlpadd
Some additional classes for allennlp.

## 1 Overview
The modules and functions I have implemented are listed below.

### 1.1 Modules
1. Span extractors registered in `SpanExtractor` :
   - `PoolingSpanExtractor` : Represent spans as the pooling (mean or max) of all tokens' embeddings , registered as `"pooling"`.
   - `MultiFeatureSpanExtractor` : A extractor to combine representations from any kinds of enabled `SpanExtractor` (i.e., `BidirectionalEndpointSpanExtractor`, `EndpointSpanExtractor`, `PoolingSpanExtractor`, `SelfAttentiveSpanExtractor`), registered as `"multi_feat"`.
   - `My*SpanExtractor` : Refactored span extractors of allennlp (specifically, I unified the `forward` and reduced the redundant code), registered as `"my_*"`.


2. Token embedders registered in `TokenEmbedder` : 
   - `AdapterTransformerEmbedder` : A parameter-effeicient way to use pre-trained BERT model on the down-stream tasks [1], which freeze BERT parameters and insert `Adapter`s into every layer, registered as `"adapter_transformer"`.
   - `AdapterTransformerMismatchedEmbedder` : The mismatched version of `AdapterTransformerEmbedder`, registered as `"adapter_transformer_mismatched"`.

3. Seq2seq encoders registered in `Seq2SeqEncoder` : 
   - `ParameterGenerationLstmSeq2SeqEncoder`: A LSTM that can dynamically generate  parameters for different domian to encode domain-aware representations [2, 3]. Coming soon.

### 1.2 Functions
1. `common`
   - `util`
      - `construct_from_params` : Construct a subclass of `FromParams` from the given `kwargs` argument dict.

2. `nn`
   - `util`
      - `batched_linear` : A linear forward with batched weights, i.e.,ever samples in the batch have the corresponding `weight` and `bias`.
      - `batched_prune` : Prune elements based on the given `scores`.


## 2 Usage

1. If you are developing your project in a git repo, I recommend using this repo as a `submodule` by `git submodule add https://github.com/izhx/allennlpadd.git`.
If not, clone to your project root by `git clone https://github.com/izhx/allennlpadd.git`.

To use functions or modules in the `import` style:

2. Directly import it from python scripts, such as `from allnlpadd.nn.util import batched_prune`.

To use registered modules in config files:

2. Add `allennlpadd` to your `.allennlp_plugins` file in your project root, or add an argument `--include-package=allennlpadd`, so that allennlp will scan and register classes in this repo when running.

3. Use the above registered classes (mainly are modules) as you need.
